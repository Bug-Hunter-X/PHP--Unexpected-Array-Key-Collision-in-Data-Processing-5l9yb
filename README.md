# PHP: Unexpected Array Key Collision in Data Processing

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP involving array key collisions when processing associative arrays that may contain non-unique 'id' keys.  The bug arises when the function `processData` attempts to use the 'id' as the array key, leading to unexpected data overwriting if two or more elements share the same 'id'.

The solution provides alternative approaches to handle the case of non-unique or missing 'id' keys, preventing data loss and improving overall code robustness.

## Bug
The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code. It shows how using 'id' as a key directly in the result array can cause data loss due to key collision.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.php` file showcases a corrected version of `processData` function that addresses this issue. It checks for the existence of the key and handles possible key collisions gracefully.
